# Beyond Python Crash Course

One of the guiding questions for Python Crash Course is, "What's the least you need to know in order to start working on interesting projects?" That's what has helped this book bring people with no programming background to the point where they can understand how to build a meaningful game, make interesting visualizations, and deploy a functioning web app, without it becoming a 1500-page doorstop.

However, once you've understood the material in Python Crash Course, there's a lot more that you're ready to learn. I may write a followup book at some point, but I've also been wanting to write up a series of articles for people who have wanted a little more detail after reading through the book.

Some of this material is just meant to expand your awareness of the fundamentals of programming in general, and Python specifically. Some of this is written to support people working on some of the Challenges, which require specific concepts that weren't included in the book.

If you have questions or feedback about anything presented here, please feel free to [get in touch](/).

Enjoy!

## Pygame

- [Using Sprite Sheets](../pygame_sprite_sheets/)

    This first extension will allow you to build games that involve lots of images. For example, a deck of cards has 52 different cards in it. If you tried to load 52 separate images, the performance of your game would suffer. Sprite Sheets allow you to load one image, and then create game elements from all of the images contained within that one larger image.
