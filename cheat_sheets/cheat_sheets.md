# Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when youâ€™re trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.

All of the cheat sheets for the first half of the book are available now, as well as the Pygame cheat sheet:
