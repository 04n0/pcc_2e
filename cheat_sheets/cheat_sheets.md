# Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when youâ€™re trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.

All of these cheat sheets have been updated to match what's in the second edition of Python Crash Course. You can download sheets individually, or [download a zip file](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v1.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_all.zip) that includes all of these sheets in one directory. You can also download all of the cheat sheets in a [single pdf file](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v1.0/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_all.pdf) if you like.
