# Cheat Sheets

Cheat sheets can be really helpful when youâ€™re trying a set of exercises related to a specific topic, or working on a project. Because you can only fit so much information on a single sheet of paper, most cheat sheets are a simple listing of syntax rules. This set of cheat sheets aims to remind you of syntax rules, but also remind you of important concepts as well.

The first three updated cheat sheets are available now:

- [Beginner's Python Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v0.1/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc.pdf)
    - Provides an overview of the basics of Python including variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, classes, and more.
- [Beginner's Python Cheat Sheet - Lists](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v0.1/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_lists.pdf)
    - Focuses on lists: how to build and modify a list, access elements from a list, and loop through the values in a list. Also covers numerical lists, list comprehensions, tuples, and more.
- [Beginner's Python Cheat Sheet - Dictionaries](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v0.1/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_pcc_dictionaries.pdf)
    - Focuses on dictionaries: how to build and modify a dictionary, access the information in a dictionary, and loop through dictionaries in a variety of ways. Includes sections on nesting lists and dictionaries, using dictionary comprehensions, and more.

You can also [download a zip file](https://github.com/ehmatthes/pcc_2e/releases/download/v0.1/beginners_python_cheat_sheet_all.zip) that includes all of these sheets in one directory.
