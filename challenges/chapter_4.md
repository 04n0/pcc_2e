## Challenge 4-1: Additional Practice

The purpose of this chapter is to understand how to work efficiently with lists. You want to be able to create a list, add items to and remove items from a list, and loop through all the items in a list. You want to be able to work with all or part of a list. You want to be able to sort a list alphabetically, and reverse a list. You want to be able to copy a list as well. You also want to style your code properly now that you're writing slightly longer files, with more than one level of indentation.

Pick a topic: games, movies, places, sports, mathematicians, celebrities, mathematical celebrities... Think of something related to one of these topics that you can store in a list. Build a list related to this topic, add some more items, remove some items, print the list, etc. Do this enough times that you feel comfortable working with lists.

## Challenge 4-2: Hearts

Make a list of all the cards in a deck of cards that have hearts on them. Your list would have items like '2 of Hearts', '3 of Hearts', '4 of Hearts'.

- Loop through your list and print out all of the cards in order.
- Loop through a slice of your list and print out just the cards with numbers on them.
- Loop through a slice of your list and print out just the face cards.

## Challenge 4-3: Full Deck

Expand on *Hearts* to generate a list containing every card in a standard deck of cards. Using loops to generate some of the cards, how efficiently can you do this?

- The full set of scores.
- The highest score.
