# Challenges & Extensions

People have often asked for more exercises than what's in the book. This is common for any learning resource; there's only so much room in a book for exercises, and many people are looking for more practice.

The following is an expanded set of exercises and challenges that go beyond what's asked of readers in the book. Many of these challenges are good starting points for deeper investigations and can be expanded into full projects. Some of them introduce snippets of code that are not shown in the book, but which are helpful for implementing more interesting examples and even mini-projects.

I suggest you pick and choose among the ones that sound most interesting, and dive deep into those. I may write some articles about how some of these challenges could be implemented, but I have no intention of developing a solution set for this overall set. The point of these is to challenge yourself to develop a working solution, and then share it with others for feedback.

If you have suggestions or feedback on any of these, please feel free to get in touch.

There isn't a whole lot of point in expanding on the exercises in the first few chapters. If you have worked through those chapters, it's much more worth your time to move forward, and dig into some challenges when you've got a little more understanding.
