# Challenges & Extensions

People have often asked for more exercises than what's in the book. This is common for any learning resource; there's only so much room in a book for exercises, and many people are looking for more practice.

The following is an expanded set of exercises and challenges that go beyond what's asked of readers in the book. Many of these challenges are good starting points for deeper investigations and can be expanded into full projects. Some of them introduce snippets of code that are not shown in the book, but which are helpful for implementing more interesting examples and even mini-projects. You can do every one of these challenges with what's been presented in the book to that point; if you need something else to do the challenge, that information is presented in the challenge itself.

I suggest you pick and choose among the ones that sound most interesting, and dive deep into those. I may write some articles about how some of these challenges could be implemented, but I have no intention of developing a solution set for this overall set. The point of these is to challenge yourself to develop a working solution, and then share it with others for feedback.

For challenges that do anything non-trivial, it can be really verbose to write a fully-specified problem description. You may need to make decisions about how to interpret some of these challenges as you work on implementations. For example, if you're asked to write a function that deals a hand from a deck of cards, you may have to decide whether you need to remove the cards from the deck, or just return the hand.

If you have suggestions or feedback on any of these, please feel free to get in touch.

Good luck, and have fun!

## Strands

- [Playing Cards](../playing_cards/)

Model a deck of playing cards in a variety of ways, and build a series of increasingly sophisticated games. If you are curious about data analysis work, analyze many simulations of a computer playing your games. You can start on this challenge as early as Chapter 3.


## Challenges by Chapter

You should finish each chapter before trying the challenges for that chapter. The challenges assume you have some familiarity with the entire chapter.

- [Chapter 4](../chapter_4/)
- [Chapter 5](../chapter_5/)
- [Chapter 8](../chapter_8/)
- [Chapter 10](../chapter_10/)
