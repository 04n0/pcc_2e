## Challenge 10-1: Simple Reader App

### Prerequisites: How to clear a termminal screen; Building a basic terminal app

Write a terminal app that allows users to read books from Project Gutenberg, one page at a time. Before coding, decide how much text should fit on one page in a terminal window.

Choose a title from Project Gutenberg. Load the file into memory, and present the first page of text in the terminal. Print two menu items: *(f) Forward* and *(b) Back*. When the user presses f, clear the screen and display the next page of text. When the user presses b, clear the screen and display the previous page of text. 

Extension: You might want to consider allowing the user to press f or F for Forward, and b or B for Back.
